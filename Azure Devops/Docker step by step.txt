Step 1: Started an ec2 instance
#Run the below command to ensure your package manager is up-to-date: 
Step2: sudo yum update -y
For Amazon Linux or Amazon Linux 2, use the following command:
          
Step 3: sudo yum install -y docker

Start the docker service:
Step 4: sudo service docker start
or
#After installation, start the Docker service and enable it to run on boot:
step 4: sudo systemctl start docker    
sudo systemctl enable docker

To run Docker commands without sudo, add your user (typically ec2-user) to the Docker group:

Step 5: sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user

Restart ec2 instance

Step 6: Write a small streamlit program in python file

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

data = {
        'Task' : ['Extract', 'Transform','Load'],
        'Status' : ['completed', 'INprogress', 'Pending']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
st.write('ETL Pipeline execution Status', df)

Step 7: Saved it and copied it from local machine to ec2 
by dragging the file to to SSH browser (SCP) Yellow round icon.

Step 8: Install Python on ec2
sudo yum install python3-pip

step 9: Install Streamlit on ec2
pip install streamlit


Step 10: Open ports to access Streamlit application from internet
o	Inbounds Rules
ï‚§	Add 8501 port in inbounds rule

Then the run the copied file
step 10: streamlit run etl.py

Step 11: copy the external URL given after running the above command.

While copying make sure the program is running some times it gets closed. 

copy url and paste it in chrome. 

make sure the url will be like- http://44.204.40.45:8503/

whatever port number at the end is there like 8503 make changes in your ec2 instance inbound rule.
