Identify the conflicting files (Git will highlight them after a merge attempt).
Open the files with conflicts and manually resolve them by choosing the correct changes.
Remove the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).
Stage the resolved files using git add.
Complete the merge by running git commit.

Review both changes carefully to determine which version is correct or combine them if needed. This decision depends on the context of the code and project requirements.

<<<<<<<: Marks the beginning of your branch's changes.
=======: Separates your changes from the incoming changes.
>>>>>>>: Marks the end of the incoming branch's changes.
You need to edit the file to remove these markers and keep the appropriate changes.

A merge conflict happens when Git cannot automatically merge changes because different changes were made to the same part of a file in two branches. It typically occurs when two developers edit the same line of code or make conflicting changes to the same file.

It ensures the code is consistent and functional. Git pauses the merge process until the conflict is resolved to prevent incomplete or broken code from being merged.

Deliver potentially shippable increments of the product at the end of each Sprint.
Collaborate on Sprint Planning, task breakdown, and execution.
Self-organize to decide how to achieve the Sprint Goals.
Maintain quality and follow technical best practices.


A time-boxed period (usually 1–4 weeks) during which the Scrum Team works to deliver a specific set of Product Backlog items.

The Product Owner presents prioritized backlog items.
The team selects items to complete in the Sprint.
The team defines the Sprint Goal and creates a plan for achieving it.
It allows the team to reflect on the Sprint and identify areas for improvement.
The team discusses what went well, what didn’t, and agrees on actionable steps to enhance future Sprints.

A User Story is a brief, simple description of a feature or functionality written from the user’s perspective.
Format: As a [type of user], I want [action] so that [benefit].
Story Points are a unit of measure used to estimate the effort required to complete a task, considering complexity, risk, and size.

An EPIC is a large user story that can be broken down into smaller, more manageable user stories.

A prioritized list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes that the Scrum Team needs to deliver.


A subset of the Product Backlog that the team commits to completing during a Sprint.
It includes tasks necessary to deliver the selected backlog items.

Sprint Planning: Define the Sprint Goal and plan work.
Daily Stand-up: Track progress and address blockers.
Sprint Review: Present work to stakeholders and gather feedback.
Sprint Retrospective: Reflect on the Sprint and improve processes.

To inspect the product increment and gather stakeholder feedback to improve future work.
